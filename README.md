# SpringBlog

This project is for the purpose of upskilling in use of the Spring Framework. To do so I will build a blog website that will make use of important Spring and Java Features.

The project will use Spring MVC to serve webpages, make use of IoC, form validation, database connection to store user and blog data, user signup and password changes. AoP will also be used in the project.

By the end of the project my goal is to be proficient with Spring Concepts and tools.
